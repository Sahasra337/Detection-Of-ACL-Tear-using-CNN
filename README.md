# Detection-Of-ACL-Tear-using-CNN
ACL tears are common injuries, especially among athletes, leading to significant morbidity and
necessitating prompt diagnosis and treatment. The detection of Anterior Cruciate Ligament tears is
hard for the timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment of knee injuries. This study inspects how
Convolution Neural Network (CNNs) is applied for the automatic detection of ACL tears from MRI
images. The data set of knee MRIs explains the presence or absence of ACL tears which was helped
to train and evaluate CNN model. The approach which is proposed involves preprocessing of the
images uses normalization and augmentation techniques which helps in improving the model’s
robustness. A CNN architecture influences transfer learning from pre-trained models, was included
to take out relevant features and to classify the images. The utilization of the trained model in a
clinical workflow can absolutely reduce the workload , diagnostic time for radiologists and making
sure of accurate patient care. By using CNN the results were improved with high accuracy and
reliability in detecting ACL tears, showcasing its strength in assisting radiologists in their clinics.
This tool has the power in significantly improving the diagnostic process for ACL injuries in best
possible manner. Along with this it also ensures timely and accurate treatment for patients. The
burden will be reduced on the professionals. The performance of the CNN model is evaluated using
metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity , specificity and the roc curve that provides insights into its
efficiency and reliability. By utilizing the capabilities of CNN’s research it creates a robust and
efficient diagnostic tool which can be integrated into the clinical workforce.
